 ### **Normal Distribution** : 
 A continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean and bell-shaped. Also is used to analyze data when there is an equally likely chance of being above or below the mean for continuous data whose histogram fits a bell curve. Statisticians refer to the normal curve as the Gaussian Probability Distribution, named after Gauss.
