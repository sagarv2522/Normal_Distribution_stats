# Normal Distribution Analysis

 ### **Normal Distribution** : 
 A continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean and bell-shaped. Also is used to analyze data when there is an equally likely chance of being above or below the mean for continuous data whose histogram fits a bell curve. Statisticians refer to the normal curve as the Gaussian Probability Distribution, named after Gauss.

# Steps of Normal Distribution

1. Plot the Histogram
2. Apply the Empirical Rule
3. Calculate the Z-score
4. Report the Insights

### **Histogram** ðŸ“ˆ :
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It is a type of bar chart that shows the frequency of data points within a range of values. The bars of a histogram are typically of equal width, and the height of each bar represents the number of data points that fall within that range.
